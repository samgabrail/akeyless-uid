# Akeyless Universal Identity Presentation
## Solving Non-Human Identity Management

---

### Slide 1: The Non-Human Identity Challenge
**70% of Infrastructure Still Uses Static Credentials**

**The Problem:**
- Static API keys hardcoded for months/years
- Manual credential distribution and rotation
- Non-human entities (CI/CD, microservices, VMs) lack proper identity
- Security breaches from compromised static secrets

**The Secret Zero Dilemma:**
- How do you securely provide the first credential to get other credentials?
- Cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/K8s) provide native identity mechanisms
- VMware, physical servers, legacy systems have NO native identity

**What We'll Demo Today:**
- Dynamic non-human identity with Universal Identity
- Live token generation, rotation, and hierarchical management
- Real secret retrieval with zero static credentials

### Slide 2: Universal Identity Workflow
**Dynamic Non-Human Identity in Action**

*[Insert workflow diagram showing the complete Universal Identity sequence]*

**Key Steps We'll Demonstrate:**
1. **Bootstrap**: Admin generates initial UID token (one-time setup)
2. **Authentication**: Client exchanges UID token → T-token  
3. **Operations**: Use T-token for secret access
4. **Self-Rotation**: UID token rotates automatically (60-min TTL)
5. **Hierarchical Management**: Create child tokens for services

**"Secretless" = No static, long-lived credentials**

### Slide 3: Live Demo Preview
**What You'll See in the Demo**

**Scenario 1: Basic Workflow**
- Generate UID token for non-human identity
- Exchange for T-token and retrieve secrets
- Zero static credentials stored

**Scenario 2: Token Rotation** 
- Automatic token rotation with TTL reset
- Old token invalidated, new token active
- Self-managing lifecycle

**Scenario 3: Hierarchical Tokens**
- Parent-child token relationships
- Service isolation and granular revocation
- Organizational structure reflected in access

### Slide 4: Non-Human Identity Benefits
**Why Universal Identity Transforms Security**

| Traditional Approach | Universal Identity |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Static API keys (months/years) | ✅ Dynamic tokens (60-min TTL) |
| ❌ Manual rotation (rarely done) | ✅ Automatic self-rotation |
| ❌ Shared credentials | ✅ Hierarchical isolation |
| ❌ Permanent exposure risk | ✅ Limited blast radius |
| ❌ Human intervention required | ✅ Zero-touch operations |

**Demo Impact**: See 90% reduction in credential management overhead

### Slide 5: Ready to Transform Non-Human Identity?
**Take Action After the Demo**

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Try the Demo Yourself**: Complete GitHub repository with scenarios
2. **Pilot Universal Identity**: Start with non-production workloads  
3. **Scale Across Infrastructure**: Implement organization-wide

**Demo Repository**: [Your-Demo-URL]

**Key Takeaway**: Non-human identity doesn't have to be a security liability. Universal Identity makes it a competitive advantage.
