echo "🎯 Key Takeaways:"
echo "  • Application Service started with admin-provisioned UID token (realistic)"
echo "  • Application Service can self-rotate without admin intervention (autonomous)"
echo "  • T-tokens are short-lived for actual operations (security)"
echo "  • UID tokens provide long-term service identity with automatic refresh"
echo ""
echo "🔄 Ongoing Operations:"
echo "  • Application Service can now repeat steps 4-6 for normal operations"
echo "  • Rotation (steps 7-9) should be automated every 60 minutes"
echo "  • No admin intervention required after initial provisioning"
